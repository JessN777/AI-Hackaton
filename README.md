# Interview.ME

OpenAI Hackathon Project built by: James, Jessica and Brian

## What it does
Insert your company, position and practice questions and Interview.ME will help provide you with feedback on how to improve your responses.

## How we built it
We have stored data on various F500 companies and common job positions so that when you select the company you are interviewing at and the type of role, our UI sends the info to our backend where we use Codex and Whisper to generate feedback to better strengthen your answers.

## Acomplishments we are proud of
- It was a first project for some of the team members
- Learning the basics of AI
- Leveraging agile software development methodologies

## What's next for Lucid AI
- Developing a more scalable solution
- Learning how to train our ML model
- Increasing the amount of data on the companies
